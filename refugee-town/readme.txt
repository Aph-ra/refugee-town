          *** Heroes of Might & Magic III : Refugee Town (mod for VCMI) ***
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
				Official VCMI Forum: https://forum.vcmi.eu/t/new-town-mod-refugee/5002

======================================================================================
 Description
======================================================================================
Refugee is a new town that takes its inspiration from WoG’s Neutral Town and H3's Refugee Camp.
The common point of its creatures is their nonbelonging to the other factions.

Thus, this castle sports concepts such as nomadism, motley armies and makeshift solutions.
The town also takes elements from the Mesopotamian, Sumerian and Akkadian mythologies.

 What this mod does ?
======================================================================================
This mod adds a brand new playable faction to the game, as well as several new spells.
