 Description
======================================================================================
Refugee is a new town that takes its inspiration from WoG’s Neutral Town and H3's Refugee Camp. The common point of its creatures is their nonbelonging to the other factions. Thus, this castle sports concepts such as nomadism, motley armies and makeshift solutions. The town also takes elements from the Mesopotamian, Sumerian and Akkadian mythologies.

 Trivia
======================================================================================
Spells:
  - 'Namburbi' was a Mesopotamian prayer that was performed during "namburbi rituals". These rituals were undertaken firstly if an omen announced a fate that was evil, and a person wished to counter-act the fate, and secondly to counter witchcraft. -- That's why the spell make ally creatures gain luck & morale (opposite of Šigû).

  - 'Šigû' are lamentations in the Mesopotamian mythology. Lamentations are either complaints, or expressions of grief or sorrow. Both meanings are related (conbined) within Šigû. -- In oppposition with Namburbi, the spell decrease enemy's morale & luck.

  - During the Middle Ages, passages from the Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Creation) were studied as a means to create and animate a golem, athough there's little in the writings of Jewish mysticism that supports this belief. It was believed that golems could be activated by an ecstatic experience induced by the ritualistic use of various letters of the Hebrew Alphabet. A golem is inscribed with Hebrew words in some tales such as the word "emet" (אמת, "truth" in Hebrew) written on its forehead. The golem could then be deactivated by removing the aleph (א) in emet, thus changing the inscription from "truth" to "death" (met מת, meaning "dead"). -- This is were comes the inspiration from the two spells 'Emet' & 'Met'.


Town:
  - The LVL7 Dwelling ("Door to Hell") comes from a natural gas field collapsed into a cavern located in Derweze, Turkmenistan which is known as the "Door to Hell" or "Gates of Hell". Geologists intentionally set it on fire to prevent the spread of methane gas, and it is thought to have been burning continuously since 1971. The gas crater has a total area of 5,350m², a diameter of 69m, and its depth is 30m.

  - The 'Secret Cave' special building is a reference to "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves" folk tale where there is a magic cave hidden inside a mountain, the mouth of which is sealed by a huge rock. Their treasure is stored inside the secret cave.

  - You can find below the origin of each city's name:
				"Shahriar"			Persian city (close to Tehran)
				"Marvdasht"			Persian city (close to Chiraz/Shiraz?)
				"Kashan"			Persian city
				"Kermanshah"		Persian city
				"Persepolia"		Persepolis (Persian city)
				"Nippur"			Ancient Mesopotamian city (Nuffar, Iraq)
				"Borsippa"			Ancient Mesopotamian city (Destroyed in 484BC)
				"Eridu"				Ancient Mesopotamian city (Iraq)
				"Nerebtum"			Ancient Mesopotamian city (Ishchali's archeologic site)
				"Gahvareh"			Persian city
				"Mashhad"			Persian saint city
				"Alvand"			Persian Hill
				"Qom"				Persian saint city
				"Atashkadeh"		Yazd's temple (Iran)
				"Kerman"			Persian city

Creatures:
  - 'Angra Mainyu' is the "destructive spirit/mentality" and the main adversary in Zoroastrianism either of the Spenta Mainyu, the "holy/creative spirits/mentality", or directly of Ahura Mazda, the highest deity. The Middle Persian equivalent is Ahriman and his name is frequently written upside down "as a sign of contempt and disgust" in the Pahlavi texts. -- The creature is basically the oriental Satan.

Misc.
  - The name "Alkephobos" (Keyvan's specialty) comes from the two ancient greek gods: "Alke", the spirit and personification of the abstract concept of courage and battle-strenght; And Phobos who is the personification of fear in Greek mythology. The fact that Keyvan starts with two spells that can control the morale and luck of every units on the battlefield is the reason behind this name.
